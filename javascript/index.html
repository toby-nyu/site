                <h2>Welcome to Tobi's Fact or Fiction News Site</h2>

                <p>We’ve separated fact from fiction to bring you the most reliable articles - 
                but sometimes the fiction is more entertaining. So here’s a site that has both!</p>

                <p>Whether you're here to learn something new or just enjoy a good laugh, 
                you've come to the right place. Our real articles cover topics like the 
                evolution of HTML, the mysteries of computer memory, and the power of 
                open source software. These are written to inform and inspire, especially for 
                students exploring web design and computer principles.</p>

                <p>On the flip side, our fictional articles dive into the absurd and the 
                imaginative - from pigeons becoming mayors to keyboards mysteriously migrating 
                across offices. These stories are designed to entertain, spark curiosity, 
                and maybe even make you question reality (just a little).</p>

                <p>Use the navigation links above to explore both sides of the digital coin. 
                And remember: sometimes truth is stranger than fiction—but fiction is often more fun.</p>
