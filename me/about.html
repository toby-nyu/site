      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Toby Brodie. I am a computer science educator with over 15 years of experience teaching programming and web development.</p>
      <p>I currently teach at NYU London, the University of London via Coursera, City, University of London, Birkbeck, University of London, and USP College.</p>
      <p>I have a passion for coding, education, and creativity. I enjoy helping students of all ages learn to code and explore new technologies.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        
         <!-- Image by Toby Brodie, placed in images folder -->
        <p>Born in England, I’ve lived in London, the North East, and now reside in a seaside town with my wife, three children, 
          and my collections of computers, vinyl, and cables. I wrote my first computer game in BASIC on a ZX Spectrum as a teenager. 
          I still own one, along with an Apple Mac Classic, several Raspberry PIs, and a vast collection of random computer cables.</p>

        <h2>Technology & Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Over the years, I’ve built up strong skills in “all things web” and computing. I enjoy tinkering with old hardware, collecting obscure cables, and experimenting with retro tech. My home office is a blend of nostalgia and utility, filled with vintage machines and modern tools.</p>

        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>When I’m not coding or marking scripts, I enjoy listening to music, getting annoyed at the news, visiting the local Odeon cinema, and eating the excellent food my wife cooks. I also care for my pet Pokémon and enjoy live comedy gigs and Radio 4’s Friday Night Comedy podcast.</p>
        <p>We also have a non-virtual pet cat, affectionately known as “The Hostile”.</p>
