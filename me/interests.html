        <h2><i class="fa-regular fa-masks-theater"></i> Music</h2>
        <p>I have a large vinyl collection and ran several record labels in the 1990s, where I wrote and produced drum and bass music.</p>
        <p>Earlier in my career, I worked as a DJ and radio presenter at various stations in the North East on England</p> 
        <p>My son also produces music - you can find his music on Spotify, although you probably won't find more than 45 seconds of mine!</p>
        <p>In my youth I worked at Midnight Electronics, a company specializing in audio and lighting equipment for events and venues.</p>
        <p>I have a strong background in audio engineering and production, which has greatly influenced my teaching methods.</p>
        <p>Additionally, my experience in the music industry allows me to bring real-world insights into the classroom.</p>

        <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-masks-theater"></i> Theatre</h2>
        <p>Back in the day, I worked as a sound technician and DJ at venues such as Riverside, Rockshots, Tuxedo Princess, and Mayfair.</p>
        <p>I also worked in theatre, including the Playhouse, Gulbenkian Theatre, and Tyne Theatre & Opera House, handling lighting, sound desks, and 
          creating sound effects.</p>

        <h2>Other Interests</h2>
        <p>I enjoy comedy, food, and playing pool. I have a keen interest in exploring different cuisines. 
        Additionally, I love watching and listening comedy, which adds a fun and light-hearted element to my life.</p>
